  <meta name="description" content="I received my double Master&#39;s Degree in Computer Science from the [University of Trento](https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/computer-science/cyber-security) and the [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/study-at-utu/masters-degree-programme-in-information-and-communication-technology-cyber-security), with Cyber Security curriculum in 2020. After two short work experiences as DevSecOps, I joined the University of Padua as a research fellow in the University of Padua as a research fellow in the [SPRITZ Security and Privacy Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mauro Conti](https://www.math.unipd.it/~conti/index.html). I am currently a Ph.D. Student in [Brain, Mind and Computer Science (BMCS)](http://hit.psy.unipd.it/BMCS), studying malware detection and privacy preserving methods applied to digital documents. I am also working with [FDM Business Services](https://fdmservices.it/), which is the company that supports my high apprenticeship program and where I try to convey my research interests. I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast, and in my spare time, I enjoy playing CTFs. If I&#39;m away from the keyboard, you can find me rock climbing or trail running in the mountains.">
