<p>Adaptable, hyperactive and tireless, I like challenges and adventures. I always wonder why things happen. I have difficulties in surviving without running and climbing.
I do research in the InfoSec field. Currently based in Padua, working with <a href="https://spritz.math.unipd.it/">SPRITZ research group</a>.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I fell in love with Bologna, where I studied <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScience">Computer Science</a> for my Bachelor. Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? That’s what I did with <a href="https://github.com/goemon07/roboRK">RoboRK</a> for my Bachelor thesis!</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/robork.png" alt="RoboRk"></p>
<p>I continued my academic career with Cyber Security. I manege to get in the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/cse/">EIT Digital Master School</a>, that allowed me to obtain a double-degree title.</p>
<p>My Master started in <a href="https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/computer-science">Trento</a>, in the North of Italy. Here is where I rediscovered the passion for the mountains, starting to climb and explore the Dolomites. The year went by quickly, although I learned a lot regarding InfoSec as well as developing a good knowledge in business development. Developing projects pushed me to mix my technical skills together with vison. Here I am with my colleague, while we expose <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fVybF173v6Q_x5KE8sDxeXETRFyRaIFoQcZk7pNh9Ws/present?token=AC4w5ViA2EbD024N0AhfotCAgukYIqGZkw:1574613190535&amp;includes_info_params=1&amp;eisi=CKCAhp-jg-YCFfDB0gQdGTAOmg#slide=id.g588222d749_0_4">Deskitup!</a> during an exhibition. We designed a prototype of a device able to maximize the effectiveness of sit-standing desks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/deskitup.jpg" alt="DeskItUp!"></p>
<p>After concluding all the exams of the first here, I moved to <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en">Turku</a>. I have adapted to Finland pretty quickly and I had the chance to visit Lapland too. Yes, I missed mountains (a lot!!!), but I still managed to climb somehow. I joined the Finnish InfoSec community, participating in various events, conferences and meetings between Turku and Helsinki. Frankly speaking, I learned a lot more from this context than the few remaining exams of the first semester.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>Even though I spent most of my time in academic environment since now, I had the chance to work for different companies for some months.</p>
<p>I’ve been an intern at <a href="https://www.teslaconsulting.it/">Tesla Consulting</a>, in Bologna. While I was working to finish my Bachelor degree, I’ve been working as a front-end developer for <a href="https://www.befair.it/">BeFair</a>. In between my Bachelor degree and the new academic year, I managed to work abroad for <a href="https://www.loccioni.com/en/">Loccioni Group</a>. I was in Stuttgart working at one of the company’s biggest clients. At <a href="https://www.daimler.com/en/">Daimler</a> I contributed to the installation of the new framework used for the control of some experimental laboratories, interfacing directly with the customer.</p>
<p>During the second semester of the Finnish experience, I’ve been working for <a href="https://www.awake.ai/">Awake.AI</a>, a startup which develops an optimization platform for maritime logistics and port operations. I’ve been a DevSecOps, having the chance to learn AWS and work with a Kubernetes for microservices&rsquo; environment and relative vulnerability scanners aimed to analyze the entire codebase.</p>
<p>Lastly, I join <a href="https://xtn-lab.com/">XTN Cognitive Security</a> as a DevOps.
After few months, I decided to jump into a totally different kind of experience.</p>
<p>I became a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.math.unipd.it/">University of Padua</a> with the <a href="https://spritz.math.unipd.it/team.html">SPRITZ Research Group</a> in late October 2021. My main topics are privacy and forensics.
I&rsquo;m currently in visiting at <a href="https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/">University of California, Irvine (UCI)</a>.</p>
