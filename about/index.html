<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently based in Italy, in the process of concluding my master thesis.
I fell in love with Bologna, whre I studied <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScience">Computer Science</a> for my Bachelor.
Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? That&rsquo;s what I did with <a href="https://github.com/goemon07/roboRK">RoboRK</a> for my Bachelor thesis!</p>
<p><img src="/img/robork.png" alt="RoboRk"></p>
<p>I continued my academic career with Cyber Security. I manege to get in the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/cse/">EIT Digital Master School</a>, that shortly will allow me to obtain a double-degree title.</p>
<p>My Master starts in <a href="https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/computer-science">Trento</a>, in the North of Italy.
Here is where I rediscovered the passion for the mountains, starting to climb and explore the Dolomites.
The year went by quickly, although I learned a lot of knowledge in InfoSec as well as developing a good knowledge in business development.
Thanks to a university course, I also tried to start <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fVybF173v6Q_x5KE8sDxeXETRFyRaIFoQcZk7pNh9Ws/present?token=AC4w5ViA2EbD024N0AhfotCAgukYIqGZkw:1574613190535&amp;includes_info_params=1&amp;eisi=CKCAhp-jg-YCFfDB0gQdGTAOmg#slide=id.g588222d749_0_4">Deskitup!</a>, a device able to maximize the effectiveness of sit-standing desks. Here I am with my colleague, while we explain our project during an exhibition.</p>
<p><img src="/img/deskitup.jpg" alt="DeskItUp!"></p>
<p>After concluding all the exams of the first here, I moved to <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en">Turku</a>.
I have adapted to Finland pretty quickly and I had the chance to visit Lapland too. Yes, I miss mountains (a lot!!!), but I still managed to climb somehow.
I joined the Finnish InfoSec community, participating in various events, conferences and meetings between Turku and Helsinki. Frankly speaking, I learned a lot more from this context than the few remaining exams of the first semester.</p>

<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>
<p>Even though I spent most of my time in academic environment since now, I had the chance to work for different companies for some months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an intern at <a href="https://www.teslaconsulting.it/">Tesla Consulting</a>, in Bologna.
While I was working to finish my Bachelor degree, I&rsquo;ve been working as a front-end developer for <a href="https://www.befair.it/">BeFair</a>.
In between my Bachelor degree and the new academic year, I managed to work abroad for <a href="https://www.loccioni.com/en/">Loccioni Group</a>.
I was in Stuttgart working at one of the company&rsquo;s biggest clients.
At <a href="https://www.daimler.com/en/">Daimler</a> I contributed to the installation of the new framework used for the control of some experimental laboratories, interfacing directly with the customer.</p>
<p>During the second semester of the Finnish experience, I&rsquo;ve been working for <a href="https://www.daimler.com/en/">Awake.AI</a>, a startup which develops an optimization platform for maritime logistics and port operations.
I&rsquo;ve been a DevSecOps, having the chance to learn AWS and work with a Kubernetes for microservices' environment and relative vulnerability scanners aimed to analyze the entire codebase.</p>
