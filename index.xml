      <description>whoami Adaptable, hyperactive and tireless, I like challenges and adventures. I always wonder why things happen. I have difficulties in surviving without running and climbing. I do research in the InfoSec field. Currently based in Padua, working with SPRITZ research group.
Education I fell in love with Bologna, where I studied Computer Science for my Bachelor. Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? Thatâ€™s what I did with RoboRK for my Bachelor thesis!</description>
