I heavily wondered about how it would have been and, honestly, it just crashed my expectations. I came home with a thousand ideas and a great desire to get to work to improve. Basically, I&amp;rsquo;m now fully charged for the upcoming academic year!

Are you looking for some cheap and clean solution too? Free?
Ok, probably you&amp;rsquo;re a bit too ambitious.
OR NOT.
I was in your situation too and now you&amp;rsquo;re visiting this website, which is built on top of the same advices you&amp;rsquo;re going to follow (hopefully!).
If you unfortunately fall into this website, probably you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the git versioning system. Probably you know about Github as well.</description></item><item><title>whoami</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 17:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>whoami Adaptable, hyperactive and tireless, I like challenges and adventures. I always wonder why things happen. I have difficulties in surviving without running, cycling and climbing. I do research in the InfoSec field. Currently based in Padua, working with SPRITZ research group.
Education I fell in love with Bologna, where I studied Computer Science for my Bachelor. Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? Thatâ€™s what I did with RoboRK for my Bachelor thesis!</description></item></channel></rss>
