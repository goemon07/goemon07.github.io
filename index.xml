Here some of my newbie&amp;rsquo;s random thoughts/tips: ðŸ‘‡
Stickers, stickers everywhere! I was planning to leave my laptop free from stickers, but now it will be so hard to stick (lol) to the plan.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to create your own website? Are you looking for some cheap and clean solution too? Free?
Ok, probably you&amp;rsquo;re a bit too ambitious.
OR NOT.
I was in your situation too and now you&amp;rsquo;re visiting this website, which is built on top of the same advices you&amp;rsquo;re going to follow (hopefully!).
If you unfortunately fall into this website, probably you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the git versioning system. Probably you know about Github as well.</description>

      <description>whoami Adaptable, hyperactive and tireless, I like challenges and adventures. I always wonder why things happen. I have difficulties in surviving without running and climbing. I do research in the InfoSec field. Currently based in Padua, working with SPRITZ research group.
Education I fell in love with Bologna, where I studied Computer Science for my Bachelor. Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? Thatâ€™s what I did with RoboRK for my Bachelor thesis!</description>
