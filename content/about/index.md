# whoami
Adaptable, hyperactive and tireless, I like challenges and adventures. I always wonder why things happen. I have difficulties in surviving without running and climbing.
I do research in the InfoSec field. Currently based in Padua, working with [SPRITZ research group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/).

## Education

I fell in love with Bologna, where I studied [Computer Science](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScience) for my Bachelor. Did you ever seen a bot for a smartphone game? That’s what I did with [RoboRK](https://github.com/goemon07/roboRK) for my Bachelor thesis!

I continued my academic career with Cyber Security. I manege to get in the [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/cse/), that allowed me to obtain a double-degree title.

My Master started in [Trento](https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/computer-science), in the North of Italy. Here is where I rediscovered the passion for the mountains, starting to climb and explore the Dolomites. The year went by quickly, although I learned a lot regarding InfoSec as well as developing a good knowledge in business development. Developing projects pushed me to mix my technical skills together with vison. Here I am with my colleague, while we expose [Deskitup!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fVybF173v6Q_x5KE8sDxeXETRFyRaIFoQcZk7pNh9Ws/present?token=AC4w5ViA2EbD024N0AhfotCAgukYIqGZkw:1574613190535&includes_info_params=1&eisi=CKCAhp-jg-YCFfDB0gQdGTAOmg#slide=id.g588222d749_0_4) during an exhibition. We designed a prototype of a device able to maximize the effectiveness of sit-standing desks.

After concluding all the exams of the first here, I moved to [Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en). I have adapted to Finland pretty quickly and I had the chance to visit Lapland too. Yes, I missed mountains (a lot!!!), but I still managed to climb somehow. I joined the Finnish InfoSec community, participating in various events, conferences and meetings between Turku and Helsinki. Frankly speaking, I learned a lot more from this context than the few remaining exams of the first semester.

## Experience

Even though I spent most of my time in academic environment since now, I had the chance to work for different companies for some months.

I’ve been an intern at [Tesla Consulting](https://www.teslaconsulting.it/), in Bologna. While I was working to finish my Bachelor degree, I’ve been working as a front-end developer for [BeFair](https://www.befair.it/). In between my Bachelor degree and the new academic year, I managed to work abroad for [Loccioni Group](https://www.loccioni.com/en/). I was in Stuttgart working at one of the company’s biggest clients. At [Daimler](https://www.daimler.com/en/) I contributed to the installation of the new framework used for the control of some experimental laboratories, interfacing directly with the customer.

During the second semester of the Finnish experience, I’ve been working for [Awake.AI](https://www.awake.ai/), a startup which develops an optimization platform for maritime logistics and port operations. I’ve been a DevSecOps, having the chance to learn AWS and work with a Kubernetes for microservices' environment and relative vulnerability scanners aimed to analyze the entire codebase.

Lastly, I join [XTN Cognitive Security](https://xtn-lab.com/) as a DevOps.
After few months, I decided to jump into a totally different kind of experience.

I became a PhD student at the [University of Padua](https://www.math.unipd.it/) with the [SPRITZ Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/team.html) in late October 2021. My main topics are privacy and forensics.
I'm currently in visiting at [University of California, Irvine (UCI)](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/).
